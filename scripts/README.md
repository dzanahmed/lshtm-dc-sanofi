# Scripts

Our Code uses R (v 4.2.2) and R Studio

Before running any script, please ensure the following:
1. Your working directory is set to the lshtm-dc-sanofi folder
--You can do this either through selecting the 'More' options section in the Files section of R-Studio
--Or, you can edit `setwd()` to the correct path on your computer to the folder
2. You have installed all the required packages, these are:
--`tidyverse`
--`cowplot`
--`stringr`
--`patchwork`

In this section, there are two types of scripts:
- Cleaning: Scripts used to scrape data from raw files and convert it to the finalised format
- Analysis: Scripts used to build figures and tables for the final report
